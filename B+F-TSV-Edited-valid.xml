            <p>This document is a simplified "true-to-text" XML version of <hi rend="italic">The Sea
                Voyage</hi> based on Pennsylvania State University's annotated copy of the 1647

                captured based on how they appear in the folio. Whenever possible, editorial
                interventions have been minimalized or avoided entirely. This document is meant to
                serve as a pedagogical tool by which students of Early Modern literature can learn

                                    lightning:</hi> In early modern plays, the stage direction
                                "thunder and lightning" was very common, and the effects of thunder
                                and lightning produced in a variety of different ways. In this play,
                                it's assumed that the stage direction "thunder and lightning" is
                                directly linked to a storm, but this was rarely the case in many
                                early modern plays (<bibl>Dessen, Alan C., and Leslie Thomson.
                                        <title>A Dictionary of Stage Directions in English Drama,
                                        1580-1642</title>. Cambridge University Press, 1999, p.
                                    231</bibl>). Making the sounds of thunder and lightning, then,
                                could have been done through drums, flashes of fire, and fireworks.
                                Thunder and lightning can be considered a sound cue and therefore
                                grouped with others such as "trumpet" and "music." These types of
                                stage directions were often created in the tiring house, as they
                                were either directed toward or written by the bookkeeper who would
                                then produce the stage directions on cue (<bibl>Thomson, Leslie.
                                    “The Meaning of ‘Thunder and Lightning’: Stage Directions and
                                    Audience Expectations.” <title>Early Theatre</title>, vol. 2,
                                    1999, pp. 11–24, p. 14</bibl>). In most cases though, the
                                effects of thunder and lightning were linked to the supernatural,
                                and accompanied figures such as devils and witches, which would
                                descend from a trapdoor that signified the underworld. An audience
                                would almost always be shown something supernatural when this
                                particular stage direction appears (<bibl>Thomson, Leslie. “The
                                    Meaning of ‘Thunder and Lightning’: Stage Directions and

                                                Shakespeare's England: a Culture of

                                            p. 112</bibl>). Thus, we can assume that there was not
                                        actually a physical ship on stage. Therefore, in order to
                                        portray some sort of sea voyage, the use of ropes, tackle
                                        boxes, and other sailing equipment could have aided the
                                        impression of being at sea, with characters pulling on cords
                                        found in the tiring house. The stage of the play was seen as
                                        the deck, the tiring house as the cabin of the ship, and the
                                        balcony as the mast or the lookout area. During this play,
                                        it's also clear that the characters on the boat are fighting
                                        against strong waves; this illusion could have been made by
                                        the characters acting wild and hysterical (<bibl>McInnis,

                                        performances in early modern England would depend heavily on
                                        the budget of the playhouse; they could range from austere
                                        and simple to grand and bombastic. Famously there would be
                                        trap doors on the stage floor to allow actors to rise from
                                        the center of the action or as ghostly premonitions..
                                        Different effects such as smoke, the firing of canons, and
                                        even fireworks could have been implemented to give the stage
                                        the air of a raging storm. These effects could have been
                                        utilized to give the illusion that the audience were
                                        actually in the center of a deadly tempest. In tandem with
                                        the acting, this could heighten the drama of the performance

                                        referring to is women, or in other words Aminta, as she is
                                        the only woman on the boat. During the time of early modern
                                        plays, women passengers on a ship were rare and even thought
                                        to bring a great amount of danger to sea voyages. The
                                        shipmaster believes that everyone on the ship is going to
                                        die because they won't have any help from the heavens, and
                                        he blames this entirely on Aminta. Many times, women were
                                        denied passage completely, so if they happened to make it on
                                        board, they were either a captive, a slave, or being forced
                                        to marry (<bibl>Akhimie, Patricia, and Andrea Bernadette.

                                        line 100, it becomes clear that Aminta has been captured by
                                        Albert, and that he has forced her to be on his ship for his
                                        own pleasure. Quite ironically, Aminta is only on the ship
                                        because of him, yet she is still being blamed for the
                                        dangerous storm.</note></l>

                                        original 1647 version of the play, question marks are used
                                        in these lines, but sometimes, in the seventeenth century,
                                        compositors would use question marks where we would use
                                        exclamation points today (<bibl>Taylor, Gary, and John
                                            Lavagnino. <title>Thomas Middleton And Early Modern
                                                Textual Culture: A Companion to The Collected
                                                Works</title>. Oxford, 2007</bibl>). Thus, Fletcher
                                        and Massinger could have meant to illustrate Aminta's raging
                                        anger and hatred for Albert if their question marks are
                                        meant to be interpreted as exclamation points. Question
                                        marks in this scene give off a completely different meaning
                                        that illustrates Aminta's confusion as to whether she should
                                        curse and hate Albert. Regardless, one cannot be sure as to
                                        when Aminta exactly falls in love with Albert, but it's
                                        crucial to consider that she is ultimately his prisoner
                                        before their love blossoms.</note></l>

                                        board this ship, there is a very interesting mix of
                                        characters from various classes. Three of the men—Lamure,
                                        Franville, and Morillat—are French lords. During the time of
                                        early modern plays, clothing established a person's identity
                                        and located their position in a variety of categories
                                        ranging from sex, class, nationality, and religion
                                            (<bibl>Lublin, Robert I. <title>Costuming the
                                                Shakespearean Stage: Visual Codes of Representation
                                                in Early Modern Theatre and Culture</title>. The
                                            Ohio State University, 2003, p. 10</bibl>). Thus, when
                                        Lamure's clothes and goods are thrown overboard, his
                                        response is that he feels completely ruined and destroyed
                                        (i.e. “undone”). Although this may seem dramatic to the
                                        modern reader, these characters feel as though their
                                        identities are being thrown away with their goods.
                                        Furthermore, because Lamure is a self-made man (lines
                                        142-146), he loses the noble identity he's created for
                                        himself and is now seen as equal to those of the lower class
                                        he spent "twenty years" trying to remove himself
                                        from.</note>

                                        listed possessions are the false dice which are trick or
                                        weighted dice. Used as a prop, they are a physical
                                        manifestation for the actor to demonstrate the kind of
                                        wayward person that he is. And if the dice are not shown on
                                        stage and are instead just mentioned by name only, then it
                                        grants a quick snapshot of someone who values a handful of
                                        cheat dice as some of the things he keeps with him when he
                                        has so few possessions. “I have nothing buy my skin, And my

                                        His possessions portray him as a kind of traveling vagabond,
                                        a wayward drifter that goes town to town and makes a living
                                        by dice and by his sword.</note> I can swim like a fish,</l>

                                        with ladies to adore ’em: Franville and Lamure complain
                                        about losing their belongings, claiming they don’t
                                        understand why they had to throw their bags overboard.
                                        Tibalt tries to defend Albert and the Captain’s orders to
                                        discard the belongings for the safety of the crew. He
                                        challenges Franville by saying there is no one here to
                                        admire his suits, i.e. there are no people to impress with
                                        the fabrics they are made up of or how he looks while
                                        wearing them. According to Tibalt, Franville’s most
                                        important suit is his own body, specifically his
                                        skin.</note></l>

                                        monologue acts as a social commentary, revolving around how
                                        much importance noblemen gave to their material possessions,
                                        to the point where they evaluated their virtues and
                                        characters based on material goods. He begins with comparing
                                        their skins to gifts from the goddess of beauty and love
                                        that would never go out of fashion or abandon them until
                                        their bodies decayed after death and were devoured by worms.
                                        Tibalt assures Franville that by being in this island, he
                                        has finally escaped brokers’ loans and the alchemists who
                                        might change the virtue of his suits into a more vitalizing
                                        disposition or sexual vigor. The purpose of this monologue
                                        is to acquaint the readers with how social hierarchy was
                                        determined by material possessions by having Tibalt satirize
                                        the social practice. He suggests that if clothes depict our
                                        accomplishments as an individual, then this hierarchy should
                                        be passed onto the fish that took hold of the
                                        clothes.</note></l>

                                        being discovered by another crew Sebastian does not go into
                                        detail about how long he and Nicusa have been stranded on
                                        the island. Their physical state and appearance provide some
                                        clues, such as “goodly long manes” and “sunk eyes”, but
                                        these details are not enough to indicate an exact number of
                                        years. This missing detail can lead to confusion later on in
                                        the play when the Amazons they briefly describe how they
                                        came to the island. The unspecified amount of years opens up
                                        interpretation not only to how long the men have been
                                        stranded, but how long they have been separated from the
                                        Portuguese women. This creates confusion when it comes to
                                        Clarinda’s experience with men and how she interacts with
                                        them, since we don’t know how old she was when she came to
                                        the island, or if she was even born yet, as she asks
                                        questions such as “Is it a man?” when she first sees

                                        suggests Albert blames nature for putting he and Aminta into
                                        this harsh environment. In the speech to nature, he portrays
                                        Aminta and himself as innocent victims. To bolster his
                                        point, he provides two examples: the first one is that
                                        nature gives a “drunkard” more wine, and a “glutton” more
                                        food, though the drunkard has already drunk and has no need
                                        for more wine, and the glutton already has enough food.
                                        Thus, Albert attempts to shame nature into providing aid to
                                        her undeserving victims.</note></l>

                                        the music from the Amazonian island that would have
                                        influences from Portugal, and possibly its colonies in the
                                        Middle East and West India. The play is written in the midst
                                        of colonial dominion in Europe, indicated by how it mimics
                                            <title>The Tempest</title>. It is possible some of the
                                        common music instruments possessed by the Portuguese (or
                                        what was imagined to be possessed by them) can be showcased
                                        on stage. One possible sound that can be recreated on stage
                                        is of the <hi rend="italic">adufe</hi>, a square
                                        double-skinned frame drum. The skins are sewn together,
                                        often with seeds between them; it is held with the thumbs of
                                        both hands and the pointer of the right hand, leaving the
                                        other fingers free to hit the instrument. This instrument
                                        was introduced into Portugal (and Spain) when the Moors of
                                        North Africa invaded the Iberian Peninsula, beginning in the
                                        early 700s A.D. As the music is also accompanied by the
                                        adjective “hunter’s,” Fletcher and Massinger may be
                                        referring to these ‘exotic’ (i.e. tribal) instruments from
                                        North Africa.</note></l>

                                        Middle East and India. Portugal had colonized several

                                        note: Rosella uses the siren to characterize Albert’s words
                                        reinforcing her argument that men are dangerously
                                        manipulative. The word “siren” can refer to mythological
                                        creatures that were part-women, part-bird or mermaid. Either
                                        form would lure sailors to destruction by their enchanting
                                        singing. Sirens have been traditionally gendered as women,
                                        but Rosella inverts this association, emphasizing Albert’s
                                        manipulation. This linguistic inversion points to the larger
                                        theme of reversing traditional gender roles within

                                        given to the French, while any girls will become part of the

                                        neighbors to an all-male society called the Gargareans. They
                                        met annually for a mating ritual. The female children born
                                        after this ritual were retained by the Amazons, and the male
                                        children went to their fathers (<bibl>Strabo.

                                        Rosella’s reference to this practice of mating with an
                                        all-male society suggests that the practice is not uncommon.
                                        It also provides some geographical hints. As the Gargareans
                                        and Amazons are believed to reign between Eurasia and the
                                        Middle East, the play hints at taking place in the
                                        Mediterranean or Black Sea (as the play references a black
                                        river between the deserted and Amazonian island).
                                        Considering the nationalities of the two groups—Portuguese
                                        and French—it is, however, more likely that this specific
                                        Amazonian community transcended from Eurasia to the western
                                        coastline of Portugal and France near the Bay of

                                        all goodness—: the long dash closing this act (present in
                                        the original folio) adds a level of ambiguity to the exit.
                                        Later instances of long dashes are used to indicate
                                        interruptions in the dialogue. Therefore, we could assume
                                        that Albert is being interrupted at the closing of the
                                        scene, though the text does not give indication of exactly
                                        what could be interrupting Albert. The long dash could allow
                                        actors to vary the portrayal of this end scene. One
                                        implication could be that Albert and Clarinda walk out of
                                        the stage with redundant pleasantries, formalities, and
                                        exchanges that the authors and printers did not deem worthy
                                        of consuming the page’s highly sought-for space. Another
                                        implication could be that the next scene immediately follows
                                        as they exit. The dash could also represent space on the
                                        page, indicating that more words were spoken here, up to the
                                        actors’ or the company’s discretion or
                                    improvisation.</note></l>

                                        dish: The use of poison and meat in this instance may refer
                                        to the idiom of the period “one man’s poison is another
                                        man’s meat,” essentially meaning “people have different
                                        tastes” or “value is relative.” The idiom was used by
                                        Beaumont and Fletcher’s contemporary Thomas Middleton in his
                                        1604 work <title>Plato’s Cap</title> (“That old moth-eaten
                                        proverb... One man’s meat, is another man’s poison”), though
                                        also by Beaumont himself in 1640’s <title>Love’s
                                            Cure</title> in <title>Comedies and Tragedies</title> (
                                        “What’s one man’s poison, Signor, is another’s meat or
                                        drink.”). As <title>The Sea Voyage</title> was performed in
                                        1622, it is plausible that the play connotes the idiom in
                                        this use of “poison” and “meat.” In this way, one can read
                                        that the palates of the shipwrecked nobles must shift from
                                        meat to mud (poison). At the same time, it may suggest that
                                        societal rules/morality is also relative: one man’s good
                                        behavior (meat) is another one’s bad (poison). But in the
                                        context of the shipwreck, “poison” suggests a kind of moral
                                        suspension: the behavior that was once bad in society is no
                                        longer bad on the island.</note></l>

                                        the primary definition of “coxcomb” is a rooster’s crest,
                                        or, a “cock’s comb.” Given that jester’s hats resemble
                                        rooster’s crests, and jesters are fools, the word “coxcomb”
                                        evolved to describe not only the jester’s cap but fools
                                        themselves. The word “coxcomb” can also describe a vain,
                                        pretentious, and foppish person, perhaps because roosters
                                        are viewed as prideful. In other words, a coxcomb person
                                        pretends to be stylish and educated. As jesters are the
                                        noble’s personal comedians and storytellers, Franville’s use
                                        takes on additional meaning. Franville’s insult could imply
                                        Aminta’s family is pseudo-nobility who amuse other nobles
                                        with their attempts at legitimacy. Given that the men
                                        believe it is okay for superiors eat their inferiors,
                                        Franville’s disqualification of Aminta’s family may justify

                                        Cannibalism in the Americas was largely reviled by

                                        there was also a medicinal cannibalistic culture thriving
                                        throughout Europe. The medicinal discourse between Lamure,
                                        Morrilat, Franville, and the Surgeon earlier in the play are
                                        relevant to this discussion in that they consider eating a
                                        “wen” that was pulled from one of the sailor’s shoulders
                                        during the voyage. Prior to this, the group primarily
                                        discusses tools of medicine; the brief mention of
                                        “cordials,” “potions,” and “pills” takes on a different
                                        meaning due to many medications being made from human parts,

                                        the humorous parts: in medieval physiology, the humors were
                                        four different fluids in the body; when imbalanced, one’s
                                        body and mood fall out of health and display the symptoms
                                        respective to the type of imbalance. The word “humorous” is
                                        also used to mean moody or capricious. Being a doctor (and
                                        thusly very knowledgeable of the humors), the surgeon wishes
                                        to remove them from Aminta’s body before the men eat her.
                                        Yet the act of removing her humors is telling. In one way,
                                        he expresses concern for his health by emptying the humors:
                                        if he were to eat Aminta’s humors, he could contract an
                                        imbalance—whether an excess or a deficit—of his own humors.
                                        At the same time, Aminta is female and so stereotyped in
                                        Early Modern drama as capricious and changeable. This could
                                        suggest the surgeon fears he could contract her emotionality
                                        over his “balanced” male rationality if he were to eat her

                                        “sharp-set” in this passage is layered. As an adjective, it
                                        describes a strong hunger. However, it is also a word used
                                        to describe hawks, hounds, and other hunting animals and
                                        their “eagerness to attack,” i.e. being “sharp-set” on one’s
                                        prey. That said, this use of “sharp-set” provides an
                                        animalistic, predatory connotation, perhaps depicting the
                                        devolvement of the shipwrecked nobles to savage beasts. Yet
                                        another definition of “sharp-set” is “having a craving for
                                        sexual indulgence,” which also promotes the connection
                                        between food and sexual craving that appears throughout the
                                        passage. For example, with the first use of sharp-set, the
                                        men argue over who gets to eat her buttocks, and with the
                                        second use, Tibalt asks if the men are so hungry that
                                        Aminta’s “flesh” must “serve” them, “flesh” and “serve”
                                        being two words that also evoke sexual indulgence. As Aminta
                                        is the only woman on the barren island, it is worth noting
                                        that the cannibalism directed towards her—i.e., to consume
                                        her—may be a sexual metaphor.</note> that her <seg

                                        of the Frenchmen, pledges their subservience to Rosella and
                                        appears to reverse the patriarchal assumptions of the
                                        pre-modern period. “Creatures,” in this sense, likely refers
                                        to someone “who owes his fortune or position, and remains
                                        subservient to, a patron,” and who also is “ready to do
                                        another’s bidding.” Thus, according to Albert, the Frenchmen
                                        are not only willing to subjugate themselves to these women,
                                        but also are willing to do their bidding (sexually or
                                        otherwise). What makes this passage especially interesting
                                        is how quickly its effects are reversed; just ten lines
                                        later, Rosella cedes power back to the men. These
                                        quick-shifting dynamics are likely related to the comedic
                                        genre of the play, as the playwrights keep switching back
                                        and forth between giving their French protagonists
                                        patriarchal power and taking it away from them.</note></l>

                                        type="context">As Tibalt explains how he selected a partner
                                        for Albert, he refers to astrology, saying that Albert was
                                        born under Saturn, “a malignant planet,” which caused him to
                                        be prone to melancholy. In the early modern period, the
                                        medical belief in the humoral system still persisted. This
                                        meant that there were four bodily “humors”: phlegm, yellow
                                        bile, blood, and black bile, that could cause various issues
                                        if they were “unbalanced.” Melancholy was the term for an
                                        excess of black bile (<bibl>“Madness and Melancholy.”
                                                <title>Encyclopedia.com</title>.
                                            www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/madness-and-melancholy</bibl>).
                                        The humoral system often was used in conjunction with
                                        theories about the planets (namely, the moon, Mars, Venus,
                                        Jupiter, and Saturn). In this case, Tibalt selects Clarinda
                                        because he claims that she is a “soft, ruddy wench born
                                        under Venus.” This, according to Tibalt should restore
                                        Albert’s balance and counteract his melancholic tendencies.
                                        Melancholy was also known to hallucinations, outbursts, and
                                        other signs of madness.</note></l>

                                        type="textual">idol of lapidary: the phrase “idol of
                                        lapidary” begins a series of descriptions of the treasure by
                                        the Frenchmen that seemingly elevates its value to a
                                        mythical quality through associations with a diverse variety
                                        of individuals—slaves, merchants, royalty, sailors—who would
                                        go to immense lengths to possess it. “Idol of lapidary” is
                                        also unique in associating the treasure with religion
                                        through the use of “idol,” implying the treasure is a divine
                                        object of worship for lapidary craftsmen, perhaps even
                                        beyond one’s love of god. While these descriptions serve to
                                        directly impress Rosella, in a larger sense they function to
                                        give the men themselves material value alongside their
                                        sexual value to the women; it is therefore of utmost
                                        importance to the Frenchmen to upsell the value of the
                                        treasure. Furthermore, in a narrative with characters like
                                        Lamure, Franville, and Morillat, whose identities are
                                        strongly rooted in their material wealth (as first seen in
                                        Act 1 during the storm), perhaps these people-related
                                        descriptions of value mirror their own views on persona and
                                        reflect a genuine desire for such treasure to re-establish
                                        their identities.</note></l>

                                        opportunity for revenge subtly contrasts Albert’s earlier
                                        pleas to heaven due to potential associations of the stars
                                        with Greek mythology and beliefs in the power of celestial
                                        bodies. While both reference some type of higher force
                                        intertwined with the Christian beliefs of the time, Rosella
                                        references a naturalistic force that, in a larger sense,
                                        emphasizes the eschewing of societal and religious
                                        conventions by Rosella and the other women of the
                                        commonwealth in their isolated environment. The women are
                                        previously characterized alongside the Greek goddess Artemis
                                        as independent, chaste hunters and with Artemis’
                                        associations with the moon. These associations imply the
                                        women subscribe to a Greek, polytheistic religion that
                                        places belief in the power of celestial bodies like the moon
                                        and the stars (<bibl>“Artemis.” <title>Encyclopædia

                                        This association also perhaps alludes to the idea of women
                                        constantly changing and being influenced by nature, not
                                        unlike the stars. Taken together with the men’s references
                                        to conventional Christian ideas of God and heaven, a
                                        rhetorical battle is created not only between religious
                                        forces, but also between genders.</note></l>

                                        resp="#student" type="textual">jointures: the original
                                        definition of “jointure” is rooted in marriage conventions,
                                        referring to an arrangement between a husband and wife to
                                        hold a property jointly so that the property may be settled
                                        on the wife if she is widowed. It also has been used an
                                        equivalent term to a dowry. Tibalt’s use of “jointures,”
                                        then, might allude to the societal and patriarchal need to
                                        establish order through marital and legal conventions,
                                        particularly as this usage occurs in the face of a woman’s
                                        (Rosella’s) anger. However, the suggested convention of
                                        “jointure” is one of the few of its time that gave women
                                        potential independence over their estate, and so it may also
                                        be rhetorically appropriate that Tibalt offers a share of
                                        further wealth to Rosella who is presumed to be widowed
                                            (<bibl>Habakkuk, H. J. “Marriage Settlements in the
                                            Eighteenth Century.” <title>Transactions of the Royal

                                            15–30, p. 15</bibl>). It is also possible that
                                        jointure’s associations with dowry suggest that an intense
                                        situation of environment isolated from societal norms could
                                        lead to a switch in gender roles, such as a man freely
                                        offering dowry directly to a woman.</note>

                                        that Sebastian and Nicusa reported being on the island is
                                        significant because it indicates Raymond’s class
                                        expectations; gallants is a term that describes young men as
                                        “smartly” or” finely-dressed” who are “gorgeous or showy in
                                        appearance.” (<bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary: The
                                                definitive record of the English language</title>.
                                            The Oxford University Press, 2019.
                                            https://www-oed-com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu. Accessed
                                            October through December, 2019</bibl>). In a way,
                                        Raymond is reminding Sebastian and Nicusa that they had
                                        described a group of men on the island who were
                                        well-dressed, which would mean they are of the higher or
                                        wealthier class. Ironically, “gallants” is a term that is
                                        very much the opposite of what one would expect to find on
                                        the barren island where there is no chance of prosperity.
                                        Because these men are so contrasting to what the island
                                        looks like and could hold, it should also be doubly easy to
                                        find them.</note></l>

                                        simultaneously. Sebastian could be stating that he does not
                                        know what foresight and/or supplies may have allowed the
                                        Frenchmen to guide themselves away from the island, but he

                                        participating in the absence of the men, and finally doubted

                                        resp="#student" type="textual">French pirates: Fletcher and
                                        Massinger give us a play that is very much a commentary on
                                        colonization. Rosella’s criticism of the French stems from
                                        her view of their actions as an attempt to control their
                                        commonwealth by robbing valuable things from them. As Rita
                                        Banerjee notes, “The critique of piracy in <title>The Sea
                                            Voyage</title> centers especially on the inordinate
                                        desire for gold and treasure” (<bibl>Banerjee, Rita. “Gold,
                                            Land, and Labor: Ideologies of Colonization and
                                            Rewriting ‘The Tempest’ in 1622.” <title>Studies in

                                            291–317</bibl>). In her lines at the start of the scene,
                                        Rosella echoes Tibalt’s sentiment at the beginning of the
                                        play when he tells the other men to resist obsession with
                                        riches at the expense of life. Because she holds the men
                                        responsible for stealing her husband’s treasure, Rosella
                                        intends to kill them as revenge, thus validating Tibalt’s
                                        prior warning and reinforcing the critique present
                                        throughout the play that riches mean nothing in the face of
                                        death; a focus on lust for gold and treasure in the play
                                        help point out the issues with such lust.</note></l>

                                        that this mixed breeding is indicative of a lower form of

                                            October through December, 2019</bibl>). This usage
                                        implies the importance of purity of nationality or race and
                                        points to an underlying conflict between the French and
                                        Portuguese throughout the play. It is also important to note
                                        that Juletta calls the Frenchmen gentlemen, but immediately
                                        rescinds that judgement when discussing their behavior. This
                                        juxtaposition of superficial appearance with demonstrated
                                        behavior denotes a key conflict throughout the

                                        I will with ‘em: Juletta’s speech here highlights a key
                                        contention throughout the play: the control of physical
                                        sustenance and that of reproductive success, both of which
                                        sustain life. Juletta is responsible for looking after her
                                        group of men, in which she is the one giving food to them,
                                        as well as exercising sexual dominance over them, as
                                        evidence by her phrasing here. The way in which hunger,
                                        thirst, and desire are regulated contrasts norms in which
                                        women of the time generally did not have agency; the women
                                        in this play, however, are the ones in charge of all
                                        physical and sexual sustenance. Though this power is given
                                        to the Amazons and reflects an agency not typically
                                        experienced by women, their drive to reproduce was is still
                                        consistent with traditional pressures on women. As Claire
                                        Jowitt puts it, “the text draws a distinction between
                                        resources needed for immediate survival—food and water—and
                                        those necessary for medium and long-term
                                        colonization—children to be new generations of settlers”

                                            93-117, p. 99</bibl>). Jowitt explains that though the
                                        women have a level of dominance as the food source for their
                                        prisoners and the survival source for their population,
                                        there is a certain amount of allusion to the burden of
                                        having such power, a burden which certainly arose within
                                        royal families when the Queen was required to produce an
                                        heir. This would have been known to a seventeenth century
                                        audience under a monarchy. Both reproductive capacity and
                                        possession of property provide authority in the play, yet
                                        both also produce a certain level of balance. Legally,
                                        marriage was actually a form of possession of a woman by a
                                        man, while she was depended upon to produce an heir, two
                                        things that put her in a position that is not entirely free.
                                        Possession and freedom work side by side in the
                                        play—possession of riches and land enables possession of
                                        other people. Though the treasure initially belonged to the
                                        Amazons, giving them power, which is then supplemented by
                                        taking the men as their prisoners, eventually the power
                                        transfers when a concord is reached by marriage.</note></l>

                                        important to note that although she and Clarinda have come
                                        from different groups, they work together to sustain Albert.
                                        Clarinda’s nutritional provision for Albert is supplemented
                                        by Aminta’s romantic/sexual provision for him, which in turn
                                        makes possible the ensuing sequence of events which ends the
                                        play in a way that ensures the survival of all involved. The
                                        idea of union between two factions is again emphasized, but
                                        beyond that it juxtaposes the threat to survival posed by
                                        division and distinction between the two groups, neither of
                                        which have all the necessary means of survival without the
                                        other. As Jowitt states, it is only “Between the separate
                                        factions [that] there are enough resources to ensure a
                                        sustainable lifestyle” (<bibl>Jowitt, Claire. "'Her flesh

                                        bottarga (potargo) is dried and salted roe sacs, usually
                                        made from mullet or tuna. It is difficult and time consuming
                                        to make because it involves salt bathes, massaging, and
                                        weeks of aging. The Master’s joke here is doubly felt

                                        considered a luxury. Bottarga is enjoyed more widely today,
                                        but it is still considered a delicacy (<bibl>Squadrilli,

                                        this line has sexual connotations because in this era
                                        oysters were viewed as a venereal symbol and were considered
                                        an aphrodisiac. More specifically, oysters were associated
                                        with vulvas. Beyond that, Gordon Williams notes that during
                                        the period a woman could be “defined through her sexual
                                        part” (<bibl>Williams, Gordon. <title>A Dictionary of Sexual

                                        The master is essentially sexualizing the Amazons and
                                        reducing them to their anatomy. “Gape” is additionally
                                        suggestive in this context as it could imply the master and
                                        Tibalt’s resent the women’s power over their own sexuality:
                                        the women are opening their own sexual anatomy and thus are
                                        in control of their sexual fates.</note></l>

                                        exchange between the characters. In response to Crocale who
                                        says Tibalt and the master are “not men,” the master assures
                                        her she will find a “salt eel” (a phallic symbol) if she
                                        should “search” them. This image is soon met by an
                                        observation that the women “gape like oysters.” As oysters
                                        were understood to represent the vagina, their gaping
                                        betrays the sexual desire of the women themselves. The
                                        phrase “crept into us” makes the sexual connotations of his
                                        speech unmistakable, allowing the “necessities” and “wants”
                                        of the women to equivocate with both sexual desire and the
                                        desire of obedience from the men. Sex is then tied to power
                                        for the women as it is to food for the men.</note></l>

                                        Tibalt and the master’s frustration with their imprisonment
                                        seems to be that they regard the Amazons’ behavior as
                                        “unwomanly.” Tibalt is willing to accept a painful death,
                                        but he refuses to accept the commanding behavior and
                                        attitude of the women in charge of him, and states that he
                                        would be willing to accept their position if they acted more
                                        ladylike and milder. Tibalt and the master seem to have
                                        strong perceptions of how women should act, and these Amazon
                                        women do not adhere to their expectations, suggesting it is
                                        the reversal of gender roles that are key to the conflict in

                                        ship as noblemen, denounce themselves to almost nothing, to
                                        rogues and knaves, and plead with Clarinda to put them in
                                        any service to live, even if it’s simply to help procreate.
                                        This exchange, and also the lines later when Morillat tells
                                        Clarinda to beat them if they offend them—which is an open
                                        admittance of their subservient positions at this time—speak
                                        to gender roles and the challenge that this play introduces
                                        to gender stereotypes. These men are now shipwrecked on an
                                        island where women are in charge and to which the men have
                                        brought almost no value; their own value, now, is
                                        procreative. In an era where men traditionally provide for
                                        the household but women ultimately create life, the power
                                        dynamic has been turned upside down, with both parties still
                                        depending on the other, but for reversed services.</note>

                                        play, may also reference a man’s sexual desire for a woman’s
                                        body. In <title>The Sexual Politics of Meat</title>, Carol
                                        Adams discusses the ways that references to meat-eating is
                                        directly linked to masculine aspects of our own modern
                                        culture (<bibl>Adams, Carol J. <title>The Sexual Politics of
                                                Meat</title>. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2015, p.
                                            1</bibl>). <title>The Sea Voyage</title> reflects this
                                        same dynamic throughout. For example, Morillat suggests that
                                        Albert captured Aminta for his own “appetite.” Throughout it
                                        is only the men who beg for meat and seem to have this kind
                                        of “appetite.” This emphasis on meat throughout, as opposed
                                        to other food sources, suggests that the <title>The Sea
                                            Voyage</title> is exploring the complicated ways in
                                        which meat and women’s bodies are equivocated during the
                                        Early Modern period. </note>

                                an extravagant display considering set design tended to be
                                minimalistic. Most of the money spent by theater companies was
                                invested more in costumes than sets. As a result, plays during the
                                period had remarkably absent stages, requiring the audience to rely
                                heavily on their imagination to furnish the setting. Seeing a table
                                furnished with lots of props would likely stand out to the audience,
                                and suggests that the table will be the center of gravity for the
                                scene. In other words, the action will revolve around the table,
                                directly and indirectly.</note>

                                        stage directions are provided to indicate Crocale is hiding
                                        or has stepped aside. Additionally, no stage directions
                                        specify that Hippolita and Juletta exit. Rather, these must
                                        simply be inferred from the dialogue. During this period,
                                        performances accomplished hiding characters in several ways.
                                        In the Blackfriars Theatre, for example, Crocale could
                                        ‘hide’ by sitting with the audience, as some of the audience
                                        in the Blackfriars Theatre sat on the side of the stage.
                                        Another place for Crocale to hide could be up on a balcony
                                        (which many Early Modern theaters had), watching the action
                                        from up above. She could also hide behind a prop or conceal
                                        herself beneath a trap door. The former, hiding behind a
                                        prop, is highly unlikely because "in Shakespeare's time,
                                        [sets] were all but nonexistent." The latter, using a trap
                                        door could have been used if the play was performed in the
                                        Rose Theater. In that theater, they probably had a
                                        hell-mouth (barrier) "covering the trap door, for devils to
                                        enter and exit" (<bibl>Syme, Holger Schott. “The Theatre of
                                            Shakespeare’s Time.” <title>The Norton

                                        important aspect of this stage direction is possibly not
                                        that Crocale is visible to the audience, but that the
                                        audience actually knows where she is hiding.</note>

                                        where gender roles are challenged. The treasures and other
                                        valuable belongings of the travelers were all aboard the
                                        ship the men, perhaps because these valuables would have
                                        been kept safe by them. Ironically, this proved to be quite
                                        the opposite; whereas the men landed on a desolate island,
                                        their crew eventually killing one another over the treasure,
                                        the women landed on the fertile island, and island
                                        containing all that they actually needed to survive. It was
                                        also said by Rosella that they became self-sufficient,
                                        learning to accomplish everything necessary for survival
                                        that they had once depended on the men for. This suggests
                                        that they did not, in the end, need men at all to thrive as
                                        a community, just as they did not require jewels or other
                                        treasures of materialistic.</note>

                                        virtues of Rosella. Jane O’Brien discusses the trajectory of
                                        a woman’s life in the period: "Whether they're mothers,
                                        ingenues or unruly woman, they are all women discovering how
                                        to find their way in the world. And it's a pretty tough
                                        world" (<bibl>O'Brien, Jane. “Shakespeare's Evolving
                                            Attitudes towards Women.” <title>BBC News</title>, 27

                                        In a way, Clarinda must now, like her mother, “find [her]
                                        way in the world,” but in a form that is only granted to her
                                        by her father. So, while she may have freedom, she may also
                                        lack it, both in this scene and, presumably, throughout her
                                        life.</note>

                                        This is somewhat unique in a 17th century comedy as comedies
                                        from this period almost always end in the actual marriage
                                        act, not simply the promise of the joining of two people. As
                                        a result, the play closes with a seemingly optimistic
                                        future, but one that has not yet come about, making the
                                        play’s ending more ambiguous than the usual Early Modern
                                        comedy formulaic.</note>
